<h2>Getting an image from Docker Hub</h2>
Docker Hub is the place where open Docker images are stored. When we ran our first image by typing

docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 rocker/verse

the software first checked if this image is available on your computer and since it wasnâ€™t it downloaded the image from Docker Hub. So getting an image from Docker Hub works sort of automatically. If you just want to pull the image but not run it, you can also do

docker pull rocker/verse
